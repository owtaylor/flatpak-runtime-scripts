    summary: 'Flatpak Runtime'
    description: >-
        This module defines two runtimes for Flatpaks, the 'runtime' profile that
        most Flatpaks in Fedora use, and a smaller 'runtime-base' profile that is
        intended to be more minimal and (slightly) more API stable. There are also
        corresponding sdk and sdk-base profiles that are used to build SDKs that
        applications can be built against with flatpak-builder.
